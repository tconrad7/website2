<h1>Trinity University</h1>

<h2>What is Trinity University?</h2><a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. It is a private, liberal arts and sciences institution that offers a rigorous and challenging education to its students. The school has a little over 2000 students with a 9:1 student-to-faculty ratio. The undergraduateprgram is designed
to allow students to explore different academic paths. All undergraduates must demonstrate skill and proficiency in various academic disciplines that are not related to their major.

<p> Trinity has a beautiful campus filled with trees and animal wildlife. 
The campus is located near downtown San Antonio and is near popular destinations like the Pearl and the San Antonio Zoo. The university also holds lectures, concerts, and theater productions for the local San Antonio community. </p>
<h2>My Favorite Features of Trinity</h2>
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are its accepting atmosphere and unique traditions. 
The atmosphere is very loving and accepting, and I always feel welcomed by the staff and other students.
I love being able to walk around campus and always see friendly, smiling faces. 
Even though Trinity is a small school, it still has its own unique campus culture and traditions.
From dunking people in the fountain on their birthday, to climbing the tower, to going to Nacho Hour every Wednesday, these traditions have been part of Trinity for generations, and I am glad that I get to experience them as well. 
These traditions embody the spirit of the university.</p></br>

<h2>Why Did I Choose Trinity?</h2>
<p>I chose Trinity University because of its strong academics, diverse student body, and close knit community. 
Although the school is difficult, I knew that the challege would be good for me and prepare me well for graduate school and future employment.
However, people at Trinity care about other things other than academics. They are involved in sports, clubs, and organizations as well.
The students are extremely diverse in backgrounds, perspectives, and identities. Finally, the close relationships within the Trinity community convinced me that this was the right school for me. 
I went to a small high school, so I was used to having close relationships with my teachers. I did not want to be just a number in class. I wanted to know my teachers, and I wanted them to know me. 
I also knew that I would be more likely to receive internships and job opportunities because of these close relationships with teachers. The close relationships at Trinity extends beyond student-faculty bonds. The students at Trinity genuinely care about each other, and it is not all about competition.
I wanted to go to a school that was academically challenging but also accepting and loving so that I could grow as a person. </p>
<h2>My Goals</h2>
<p>I am thinking of majoring in business administration with a concentration in marketing because because I think the persuasion techniques in marketing are fascinating. 
Marketing allows for both individual thinking and collaboration. You have to be able to work on your own and with other people. It is the perfect balance of creativity and structure, since it requires both strategic thinking and innovation.
